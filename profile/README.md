# Coexistence Conservation Lab

Our [Lab](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/) is a research group lead by [Professor Adrian Manning](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/adrian-manning-profile) in the Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University. Our committed members have a variety of expertise and partnerships with government, NGOs, and other institutions, enabling us to integrate research and restoration with meaningful outcomes for conservation in Australia and around the world.

Our work spans the themes of: 
  - [Rewilding](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/rewilding),
  - [Conservation genetics](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/conservation-genetics), 
  - [Translocation science](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/translocation-science), 
  - [Conservation biology](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/conservation-biology), and 
  - [Coexistence conservation](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/coexistence-conservation)

Our projects include:
  - [MFGO Woodland Experiment](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/mulligans-flat-goorooyarroo-woodland-experiment), 
  - [Ginninderry Conservation Corridor](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/ginninderry-conservation-corridor), 
  - [Super parrot project](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/superb-parrot-project), 
  - [Kielderhead Wildwood](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/kielderhead-wildwood), and
  - [Odonata Foundation](https://www.coexistenceconservationlab.org/odonata).

## Our philosophy

Predation by invasive species is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, and it is difficult to tackle. Two ways to address biodiversity decline include (**a**) protecting the species currently existing in the wild, and (**b**) reintroducing species to their indigenous ranges.

These conservation actions are ambitious. They cannot depend on the total eradication of invasive species, and time will not slow down to give native species enough time to adjust to the irreversible changes we have made to their habitats and ecosystems. If we are to restore ecosystems, conservation efforts must be driven by evidence, collaboration, and insight. It must be based in respect for, and understanding of, the processes of the natural world. Our Lab operates with respect and an endless curiosity toward the species and systems we study and work to preserve. We seek solutions in their ecology and their DNA, and use innovative approaches to apply this knowledge effectively.

## Acknowledgement of Country

We acknowledge Australiaâ€™s First Nations peoples as its first scientists and Traditional Custodians. We recognise their  ongoing role in caring for Country and pay our respects to their elders past and present.
